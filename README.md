# PhD_Thesis
Just some files for PHD Thesis chapters. Scripts, raw files, etc
I tried to keep as much explanatory data as possible, from raw to curated, in a way that makes the most sense (there was a LOT of data to soft through).

Many files were too big to upload (like SNP matrices or some VCF files), but some files were small enough to be left as templates. 
All data can be regenerated from the scripts and NCYC's WGS data.

It allows viewing; should permit download.
